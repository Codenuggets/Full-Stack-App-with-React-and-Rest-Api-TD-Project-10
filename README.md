# Full Stack App with React and Rest Api TD Project 10
 Front end client built with React that consumes a rest api built in a previous project

## Getting started
In this project, there are two main folders, `api` and `client`. You will need to open 2 separate terminals and navigate to each folder. In the api folder, you will need to run `npm install` followed by `npm run seed` to populate the database. Then you can run `npm start` to start and run the database on `localhost:5000`. In the client folder, you will need to run `npm install` and then `npm start`. Your default browser should automatically open `localhost:3000`
